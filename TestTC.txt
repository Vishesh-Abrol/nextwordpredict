i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape hard and much the worse for wear the lining had been of red silk but was a good deal discoloured there was no makers name but as holmes had remarked the initials h b were scrawled upon one side it was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer but the elastic was missing for the rest it was cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink i can see nothing said i handing it back to my friend on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail however to reason from what you see you are too timid in drawing your inferences then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days he had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him my dear holmes he has however retained some degree of self-respect he continued disregarding my remonstrance he is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middle-aged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with lime-cream these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house you are certainly joking holmes not in the least is it possible that even now when i give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i am unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them very naturally by the way about the bird we were compelled to eat it to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of relief of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish— the man burst into a hearty laugh they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure said he but beyond that i can hardly see what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be to me no sir i think that with your permission nothing had been said during our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous tension within him here we are said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room the fire looks very seasonable in this weather you look cold mr ryder pray take the basket-chair i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours now then you want to know what became of those geese yes sir or rather i fancy of that goose it was one bird i imagine in which you were interested—white with a black bar across the tail ryder quivered with emotion oh sir he cried can you tell me where it went to it came here here yes and a most remarkable bird it proved i dont wonder that you should take an interest in it it laid an egg after it was dead—the bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen i have it here in my museum our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold brilliant many-pointed radiance ryder stood glaring with a drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it the games up ryder said holmes quietly hold up man or youll be into the fire give him an arm back into his chair watson hes not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity give him a dash of brandy so now he looks a little more human what a shrimp it is to be sure for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser i have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which i could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the countess of morcars it was catherine cusack who told me of it said he in a crackling voice i see—her ladyships waiting-maid well the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used it seems to me ryder that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you you knew that this man horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him what did you do then you made some small job in my ladys room—you and your confederate cusack—and you managed that he should be the man sent for then when he had left you rifled the jewel-case raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested you then— ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companions knees for gods sake have mercy he shrieked think of my father of my mother it would break their hearts i never went wrong before i never will again i swear it ill swear it on a bible oh dont bring it into court for christs sake dont get back into your chair said holmes sternly it is very well to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing i will fly mr holmes i will leave the country sir then the charge against him will break down hum we will talk about that and now let us hear a true account of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips i will tell you it just as it happened sir said he when horner had been arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe i went out as if on some commission and i made for my sisters house she had married a man named oakshott and lived in brixton road where she fattened fowls for the market all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective and for all that it was a cold night the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road my sister asked me what was the matter and why i was so pale but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel then i went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do i had a friend once called maudsley who went to the bad and has just been serving his time in pentonville one day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole i knew that he would be true to me for i knew one or two things about him so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn where he lived and take him into my confidence he would show me how to turn the stone into money but how to get to him in safety i thought of the agonies i had gone through in coming from the hotel i might at any moment be seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the best detective that ever lived my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present and i knew that she was always as good as her word i would take my goose now and in it i would carry my stone to kilburn there was a little shed in the yard and behind this i drove one of the birds—a fine big one white with a barred tail i caught it and prying its bill open i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach the bird gave a gulp and i felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop but the creature flapped and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the matter as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others whatever were you doing with that bird jem says she well said i you said youd give me one for christmas and i was feeling which was the fattest oh says she weve set yours aside for you—jems bird we call it its the big white one over yonder theres twenty-six of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen for the market thank you maggie says i but if it is all the same to you id rather have that one i was handling just now the other is a good three pound heavier said she and we fattened it expressly for you never mind ill have the other and ill take it now said i oh just as you like said she a little huffed which is it you want then that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the flock oh very well kill it and take it with you well i did what she said mr holmes and i carried the bird all the way to kilburn i told my pal what i had done for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to he laughed until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose my heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred i left the bird rushed back to my sisters and hurried into the back yard there was not a bird to be seen there where are they all maggie i cried gone to the dealers jem which dealers breckinridge of covent garden but was there another with a barred tail i asked the same as the one i chose yes jem there were two barred-tailed ones and i could never tell them apart well then of course i saw it all and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge but he had sold the lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone you heard him yourselves to-night well he has always answered me like that my sister thinks that i am going mad sometimes i think that i am myself and now—and now i am myself a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character god help me god help me he burst into convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands there was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes finger-tips upon the edge of the table then my friend rose and threw open the door get out said he what sir oh heaven bless you no more words get out and no more words were needed there was a rush a clatter upon the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street after all watson said holmes reaching up his hand for his clay pipe i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies if horner were in danger it would be another thing but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must collapse i suppose that i am commuting a felony but it is just possible that i am saving a soul this fellow will not go wrong again he is too terribly frightened send him to gaol now and you make him a gaol-bird for life besides it is the season of forgiveness chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward if you will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief feature viii the adventure of the speckled band on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic of all these varied cases however i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the time from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth it was early in april in the year 83 that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my bed he was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven i blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for i was myself regular in my habits very sorry to knock you up watson said he but its the common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and i on you what is it then—a fire no a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she is waiting now in the sitting-room now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations and in admiring the rapid deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in the window rose as we entered good-morning madam said holmes cheerily my name is sherlock holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha i am glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the fire pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you are shivering it is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low voice changing her seat as requested what then it is fear mr holmes it is terror she raised her veil as she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick all-comprehensive glances you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting her forearm we shall soon set matters right i have no doubt you have come in by train this morning i see you know me then no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart along heavy roads before you reached the station the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said she i started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues i have no one to turn to—none save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small case-book which he consulted farintosh said he ah yes i recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara i think it was before your time watson i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend as to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but i have heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me i am all attention madam my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey holmes nodded his head the name is familiar to me said he the family was at one time among the richest in england and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west in the last century however four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency nothing was left save a few acres of ground and the two-hundred-year-old house which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage the last squire dragged out his existence there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he established a large practice in a fit of anger however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man when dr roylott was in india he married my mother mrs stoner the young widow of major-general stoner of the bengal artillery my sister julia and i were twins and we were only two years old at the time of my mothers re-marriage she had a considerable sum of money—not less than £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to dr roylott entirely while we resided with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage shortly after our return to england my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe dr roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family and in my stepfathers case it had i believe been intensified by his long residence in the tropics a series of disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the police-court until at last he became the terror of the village and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end he has a passion also for indian animals which are sent over to him by a correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has your sister is dead then she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position we had however an aunt my mothers maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a half-pay major of marines to whom she became engaged my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor pray be precise as to details said he it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory the manor-house is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms the first is dr roylotts the second my sisters and the third my own there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain perfectly so the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn that fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early though we knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke she left her room therefore and came into mine where she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding at eleven oclock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night never said i i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep certainly not but why because during the last few nights i have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle i am a light sleeper and it has awakened me i cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn i thought that i would just ask you whether you had heard it no i have not it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation very likely and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you did not hear it also ah but i sleep more heavily than you well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock indeed said holmes was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night always and why i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked quite so pray proceed with your statement i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew that it was my sisters voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen as i ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it horror-stricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by the light of the corridor-lamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was the band the speckled band there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctors room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown when he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound could you swear to it that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived was your sister dressed no she was in her night-dress in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a match-box showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did the coroner come to he investigated the case with great care for dr roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end besides there were no marks of any violence upon her how about poison the doctors examined her for it but without success what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine were there gipsies in the plantation at the time yes there are nearly always some there ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled band sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied these are very deep waters said he pray go on with your narrative two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage his name is armitage—percy armitage—the second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dog-cart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice you have done wisely said my friend but have you told me all yes all miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather why what do you mean for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitors knee five little livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist you have been cruelly used said holmes the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist he is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength there was a long silence during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire this is a very deep business he said at last there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action yet we have not a moment to lose if we were to come to stoke moran to-day would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather as it happens he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way excellent you are not averse to this trip watson by no means then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town but i shall return by the twelve oclock train so as to be there in time for your coming and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some small business matters to attend to will you not wait and breakfast no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room and what do you think of it all watson asked sherlock holmes leaning back in his chair it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business dark enough and sinister enough yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman i cannot think when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines but what then did the gipsies do i cannot imagine i see many objections to any such theory and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of the devil the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a black top-hat a long frock-coat and a pair of high gaiters with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side a large face seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other of us while his deep-set bile-shot eyes and his high thin fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey which of you is holmes asked this apparition my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my companion quietly i am dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran indeed doctor said holmes blandly pray take a seat i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i have traced her what has she been saying to you it is a little cold for the time of the year said holmes what has she been saying to you screamed the old man furiously but i have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my companion imperturbably ha you put me off do you said our new visitor taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop i know you you scoundrel i have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler my friend smiled holmes the busybody his smile broadened holmes the scotland yard jack-in-office holmes chuckled heartily your conversation is most entertaining said he when you go out close the door for there is a decided draught i will go when i have had my say dont you dare to meddle with my affairs i know that miss stoner has been here i traced her i am a dangerous man to fall foul of see here he stepped swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room he seems a very amiable person said holmes laughing i am not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter it was nearly one oclock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures i have seen the will of the deceased wife said he to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the total income which at the time of the wifes death was little short of £ 1100 is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than £ 750 each daughter can claim an income of £ 250 in case of marriage it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent my mornings work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket an eleys no 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a tooth-brush are i think all that we need at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes it was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows look there said he a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion stoke moran said he yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked the driver there is some building going on there said holmes that is where we are going theres the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the footpath over the fields there it is where the lady is walking and the lady i fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading his eyes yes i think we had better do as you suggest we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead i thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business it may stop his gossip good-afternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as our word our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy i have been waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands with us warmly all has turned out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening we have had the pleasure of making the doctors acquaintance said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened good heavens she cried he has followed me then so it appears he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what will he say when he returns he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him to-night if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine the building was of grey lichen-blotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin the central portion was in little better repair but the right-hand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stone-work had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to dr roylotts chamber exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there are windows in it of course yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass through as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry hum said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her fate it was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old country-houses a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window these articles with two small wicker-work chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown worm-eaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment where does that bell communicate with he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow it goes to the housekeepers room it looks newer than the other things yes it was only put there a couple of years ago your sister asked for it i suppose no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug why its a dummy said he wont it ring no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is how very absurd i never noticed that before very strange muttered holmes pulling at the rope there are one or two very singular points about this room for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air that is also quite modern said the lady done about the same time as the bell-rope remarked holmes yes there were several little changes carried out about that time they seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy bell-ropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment dr grimesby roylotts chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter but was as plainly furnished a camp-bed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest whats in here he asked tapping the safe my stepfathers business papers oh you have seen inside then only once some years ago i remember that it was full of papers there isnt a cat in it for example no what a strange idea well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it no we dont keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention thank you that is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket hullo here is something interesting the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed the lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord what do you make of that watson its a common enough lash but i dont know why it should be tied that is not quite so common is it ah me its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn i had never seen my friends face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation we had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect i shall most certainly do so the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may depend upon your compliance i assure you that i am in your hands in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the village inn over there yes that is the crown very good your windows would be visible from there certainly you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger for half an hour i sat with straining ears then suddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull you see it watson he yelled you see it but i saw nothing at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely i could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened it swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose what can it mean i gasped it means that it is all over holmes answered and perhaps after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylotts room with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand it was a singular sight which met our eyes on the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion the band the speckled band whispered holmes i took a step forward in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent it is a swamp adder cried holmes the deadliest snake in india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened as he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead mans lap and throwing the noose round the reptiles neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arms length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day i had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door my attention was speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed the discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i was probably on the right track the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage it would be a sharp-eyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work then i thought of the whistle of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim he had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed it might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance i did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey shepherds check trousers a not over-clean black frock-coat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament a frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing else mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion how in the name of good-fortune did you know all that mr holmes he asked how did you know for example that i did manual labour its as true as gospel for i began as a ships carpenter your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed well the snuff then and the freemasonry i wont insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arc-and-compass breastpin ah of course i forgot that but the writing what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk well but china the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain the matter becomes even more simple mr jabez wilson laughed heavily well i never said he i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after all i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake in explaining _omne ignotum pro magnifico_ you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began it all you just read it for yourself sir i took the paper from him and read as follows: to the red-headed league: on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania usa there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of £ 4 a week for purely nominal services all red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league 7 popes court fleet street what on earth does this mean i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits it is a little off the beaten track isnt it said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date it is _the morning chronicle_ of april 27 1890 just two months ago very good now mr wilson well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a small pawnbrokers business at coburg square near the city its not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes his name is vincent spaulding and hes not such a youth either its hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who comes under the full market price it is not a common experience among employers in this age i dont know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker theres no vice in him he is still with you i presume yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean—thats all i have in the house for i am a widower and never had any family we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more the first thing that put us out was that advertisement spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says: i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a red-headed man why that i asks why says he heres another vacancy on the league of the red-headed men its worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money if my hair would only change colour heres a nice little crib all ready for me to step into why what is it then i asked you see mr holmes i am a very stay-at-home man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat in that way i didnt know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news have you never heard of the league of the red-headed men he asked with his eyes open never why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies and what are they worth i asked oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with ones other occupations well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy tell me all about it said i well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars as far as i can make out the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself red-headed and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do but said i there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply not so many as you might think he answered you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement fleet street was choked with red-headed folk and popes court looked like a costers orange barrow i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of colour they were—straw lemon orange brick irish-setter liver clay but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has every requirement i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will however i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as he released me i perceive that all is as it should be but we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint i could tell you tales of cobblers wax which would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson have you a family i answered that i had not his face fell immediately dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i am sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right in the case of another said he the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties well it is a little awkward for i have a business already said i oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spaulding i should be able to look after that for you what would be the hours i asked ten to two now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just before pay-day so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings besides i knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up that would suit me very well said i and the pay is £ 4 a week and the work is purely nominal what do you call purely nominal well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole position forever the will is very clear upon that point you dont comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time its only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving said i no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your billet and the work is to copy out the _encyclopædia britannica_ there is the first volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and blotting-paper but we provide this table and chair will you be ready to-morrow certainly i answered then good-bye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased at my own good fortune well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in low spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be i could not imagine it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the _encyclopædia britannica_ vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing however in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quill-pen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for popes court well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me at two oclock he bade me good-day complimented me upon the amount that i had written and locked the door of the office after me this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my weeks work it was the same next week and the same the week after every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all still of course i never dared to leave the room for an instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk the loss of it eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the bs before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end to an end yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper it read in this fashion: the red-headed league is dissolved october 9 1890 sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen i really wouldnt miss your case for the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the red-headed league he said that he had never heard of any such body then i asked him who mr duncan ross was he answered that the name was new to him well said i the gentleman at no 4 what the red-headed man yes oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday where could i find him oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes 17 king edward street near st pauls i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross and what did you do then asked holmes i went home to saxe-coburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear grave enough said mr jabez wilson why i have lost four pound a week as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some £ 30 to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you about a month then how did he come in answer to an advertisement was he the only applicant no i had a dozen why did you pick him because he was handy and would come cheap at half wages in fact yes what is he like this vincent spaulding small stout-built very quick in his ways no hair on his face though hes not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his forehead holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement i thought as much said he have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings yes sir he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still with you oh yes sir i have only just left him and has your business been attended to in your absence nothing to complain of sir theres never very much to do of a morning that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two to-day is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all i make nothing of it i answered frankly it is a most mysterious business as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this matter what are you going to do then i asked to smoke he answered it is quite a three pipe problem and i beg that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece sarasate plays at the st jamess hall this afternoon he remarked what do you think watson could your patients spare you for a few hours i have nothing to do to-day my practice is never very absorbing then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspective and i want to introspect come along we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short walk took us to saxe-coburg square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning it was a poky little shabby-genteel place where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with jabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally he returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by a bright-looking clean-shaven young fellow who asked him to step in thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known something of him before evidently said i mr wilsons assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the red-headed league i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him not him what then the knees of his trousers and what did you see what i expected to see why did you beat the pavement my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemys country we know something of saxe-coburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxe-coburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line i should like just to remember the order of the houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london there is mortimers the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlanes carriage-building depot that carries us right on to the other block and now doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violin-land where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuth-hound holmes the relentless keen-witted ready-handed criminal agent as it was possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st jamess hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged yes it would be as well and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at coburg square is serious why serious a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but to-day being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help to-night at what time ten will be early enough i shall be at baker street at ten very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes here i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the _encyclopædia_ down to the visit to saxe-coburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me what was this nocturnal expedition and why should i go armed where were we going and what were we to do i had the hint from holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbrokers assistant was a formidable man—a man who might play a deep game i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation it was a quarter-past nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom i recognised as peter jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sad-faced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in to-nights adventure were hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in his consequential way our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed mr merryweather gloomily you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which are if he wont mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the stranger with deference still i confess that i miss my rubber it is the first saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that i have not had my rubber i think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather the stake will be some £ 30000 and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger hes a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london hes a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself hell crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next ive been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night ive had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into farrington street we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter i thought it as well to have jones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we are and they are waiting for us we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earth-smelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes severely you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present it is our french gold whispered the director we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it your french gold yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30000 napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject which were very well justified observed holmes and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern and sit in the dark i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a _partie carrée_ you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moments notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back through the house into saxe-coburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you jones i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier in-breath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones its disappearance however was but momentary with a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern over the edge there peeped a clean-cut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high until one knee rested upon the edge in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair its all clear he whispered have you the chisel and the bags great scott jump archie jump and ill swing for it sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came down on the mans wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor its no use john clay said holmes blandly you have no chance at all so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coat-tails there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely i must compliment you and i you holmes answered your red-headed idea was very new and effective youll see your pal again presently said jones hes quicker at climbing down holes than i am just hold out while i fix the derbies i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins have the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and please all right said jones with a stare and a snigger well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police-station that is better said john clay serenely he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr john clay said holmes i have been at some small expense over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red-headed league you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the _encyclopædia_ must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggested to clays ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplices hair the £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation but how could you guess what the motive was had there been women in the house i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the mans business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at it must then be something out of the house what could it be i thought of the assistants fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangled clue then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london he was doing something in the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end what could it be once more i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hoped the assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before i hardly looked at his face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friends premises and felt that i had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night i asked well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilsons presence—in other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape for all these reasons i expected them to come to-night you reasoned it out beautifully i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration it is so long a chain and yet every link rings true it saved me from ennui he answered yawning alas i already feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little problems help me to do so and you are a benefactor of the race said i he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked _lhomme cest rien—lœuvre cest tout_ as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand iii a case of identity my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the cross-purposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most _outré_ results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable and yet i am not convinced of it i answered the cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked holmes this is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace i smiled and shook my head i can quite understand your thinking so i said of course in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre but here—i picked up the morning paper from the ground—let us put it to a practical test here is the first heading upon which i come a husbands cruelty to his wife there is half a column of print but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument said holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it this is the dundas separation case and as it happens i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it the husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example he held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it ah said he i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers and the ring i asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems and have you any on hand just now i asked with interest some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest they are important you understand without being interesting indeed i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest it is possible however that i may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted london street looking over his shoulder i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell i have seen those symptoms before said holmes throwing his cigarette into the fire oscillation upon the pavement always means an _affaire de cœur_ she would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet even here we may discriminate when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting i did at first she answered but now i know where the letters are without looking then suddenly realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad good-humoured face youve heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know all that never mind said holmes laughing it is my business to know things perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook if not why should you come to consult me i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead oh mr holmes i wish you would do as much for me im not rich but still i have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry asked sherlock holmes with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland yes i did bang out of the house she said for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr windibank—that is my father—took it all he would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and i just on with my things and came right away to you your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the name is different yes my stepfather i call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself and your mother is alive oh yes mother is alive and well i wasnt best pleased mr holmes when she married again so soon after fathers death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines they got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest which wasnt near as much as father could have got if he had been alive i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention your own little income he asked does it come out of the business oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying 4½ per cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can only touch the interest you interest me extremely said holmes and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60 i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you understand that as long as i live at home i dont wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them of course that is only just for the time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting it brings me twopence a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day you have made your position very clear to me said holmes this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr hosmer angel a flush stole over miss sutherlands face and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket i met him first at the gasfitters ball she said they used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he never did wish us to go anywhere he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sunday-school treat but this time i was set on going and i would go for what right had he to prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all fathers friends were to be there and he said that i had nothing fit to wear when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went mother and i with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there i met mr hosmer angel i suppose said holmes that when mr windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball oh well he was very good about it he laughed i remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way i see then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel yes sir i met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met him—that is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more no well you know father didnt like anything of the sort he wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see you well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know were you engaged to the gentleman at this time oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that we took hosmer—mr angel—was a cashier in an office in leadenhall street—and— what office thats the worst of it mr holmes i dont know where did he live then he slept on the premises and you dont know his address no—except that it was leadenhall street where did you address your letters then to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of it was most suggestive said holmes it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel he was a very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous very retiring and gentlemanly he was even his voice was gentle hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather returned to france mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever happened i would always be true to him mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him i didnt quite like that mr holmes it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but i didnt want to do anything on the sly so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it with the result of driving it through the ventilator and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr grimesby roylotts death and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience ix the adventure of the engineers thumb of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his notice—that of mr hatherleys thumb and that of colonel warburtons madness of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results the story has i believe been told more than once in the newspapers but like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect it was in the summer of 89 not long after my marriage that the events occurred which i am now about to summarise i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us my practice had steadily increased and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station i got a few patients from among the officials one of these whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence one morning at a little before seven oclock i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room i dressed hurriedly for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs as i descended my old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him ive got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his shoulder hes all right what is it then i asked for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room its a new patient he whispered i thought id bring him round myself then he couldnt slip away there he is all safe and sound i must go now doctor i have my dooties just the same as you and off he went this trusty tout without even giving me time to thank him i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains he was young not more than five-and-twenty i should say with a strong masculine face but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his strength of mind to control i am sorry to knock you up so early doctor said he but i have had a very serious accident during the night i came in by train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here i gave the maid a card but i see that she has left it upon the side-table i took it up and glanced at it mr victor hatherley hydraulic engineer 16a victoria street (3rd floor) that was the name style and abode of my morning visitor i regret that i have kept you waiting said i sitting down in my library-chair you are fresh from a night journey i understand which is in itself a monotonous occupation oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and laughed he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh stop it i cried pull yourself together and i poured out some water from a caraffe it was useless however he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone presently he came to himself once more very weary and pale-looking i have been making a fool of myself he gasped not at all drink this i dashed some brandy into the water and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks thats better said he and now doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have been it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots good heavens i cried this is a terrible injury it must have bled considerably yes it did i fainted when it was done and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time i should like however to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do quite so it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers entirely then the matter stands thus you are probably aware that fullers-earth is a valuable product and that it is only found in one or two places in england i have heard so some little time ago i bought a small place—a very small place—within ten miles of reading i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fullers-earth in one of my fields on examining it however i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left—both of them however in the grounds of my neighbours these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this i took a few of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields this we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press this press as i have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject we guard our secret very jealously however and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts came out it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans that is why i have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being i shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to london by the evening train and leave your case unfinished no finished but the mystery it is solved who was the criminal then the gentleman i describe but who is he surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a populous neighbourhood lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am a practical man he said and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg i should become the laughing-stock of scotland yard all right said holmes quietly i have given you the chance here are your lodgings good-bye i shall drop you a line before i leave having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little i dont know quite what to do and i should value your advice light a cigar and let me expound pray do so well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthys narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying reference to a rat he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the sons ear now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true what of this cooee then well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chance that he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia what of the rat then sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table this is a map of the colony of victoria he said i wired to bristol for it last night he put his hand over part of the map what do you read arat i read and now he raised his hand ballarat quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat it is wonderful i exclaimed it is obvious and now you see i had narrowed the field down considerably the possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the sons statement to be correct was a certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak certainly and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander quite so then comes our expedition of to-day by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal but how did you gain them you know my method it is founded upon the observation of trifles his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride his boots too might be told from their traces yes they were peculiar boots but his lameness the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left he put less weight upon it why because he limped—he was lame but his left-handedness you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son he had even smoked there i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar i have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found the ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it it was an indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam and the cigar-holder i could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefore he used a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt pen-knife holmes i said you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him i see the direction in which all this points the culprit is— mr john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sitting-room and ushering in a visitor the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure his slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deep-lined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character his tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently you had my note yes the lodge-keeper brought it up you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal i thought people would talk if i went to the hall and why did you wish to see me he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words it is so i know all about mccarthy the old man sank his face in his hands god help me he cried but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it would break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested it may not come to that said holmes what i am no official agent i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests young mccarthy must be got off however i am a dying man said old turner i have had diabetes for years my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him just tell us the truth he said i shall jot down the facts you will sign it and watson here can witness it then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed its as well said the old man its a question whether i shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but i should wish to spare alice the shock and now i will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell you didnt know this dead man mccarthy he was a devil incarnate i tell you that god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he his grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life ill tell you first how i came to be in his power it was in the early 60s at the diggings i was a young chap then hot-blooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything i got among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber there were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it there were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley three of our boys were killed however before we got the swag i put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver who was this very man mccarthy i wish to the lord that i had shot him then but i spared him though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every feature we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to england without being suspected there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life i bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which i had earned it i married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done in a word i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot here we are jack says he touching me on the arm well be as good as a family to you theres two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us if you dont—its a fine law-abiding country is england and theres always a policeman within hail well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness turn where i would there was his cunning grinning face at my elbow it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which i could not give he asked for alice his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property but there i was firm i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that i had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough i stood firm mccarthy threatened i braved him to do his worst we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over when i went down there i found him talking with his son so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this could i not snap the bond i was already a dying and a desperate man though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb i knew that my own fate was sealed but my memory and my girl both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue i did it mr holmes i would do it again deeply as i have sinned i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast his cry brought back his son but i had gained the cover of the wood though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight that is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation i pray not sir and what do you intend to do in view of your health nothing you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it if not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us farewell then said the old man solemnly your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room god help us said holmes after a long silence why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxters words and say there but for the grace of god goes sherlock holmes james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel old turner lived for seven months after our interview but he is now dead and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past v the five orange pips when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases between the years 82 and 90 i am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him there is however one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been and probably never will be entirely cleared up the year 87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest of which i retain the records among my headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque _sophy anderson_ of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the camberwell poisoning case in the latter as may be remembered sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead mans watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case all these i may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe it was in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great hand-made london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage as evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime while i at the other was deep in one of clark russells fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves my wife was on a visit to her mothers and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street why said i glancing up at my companion that was surely the bell who could come to-night some friend of yours perhaps except yourself i have none he answered i do not encourage visitors a client then if so it is a serious case nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landladys sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit come in said he the man who entered was young some two-and-twenty at the outside well-groomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and i could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety i owe you an apology he said raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes i trust that i am not intruding i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber give me your coat and umbrella said holmes they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently you have come up from the south-west i see yes from horsham that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive i have come for advice that is easily got and help that is not always so easy i have heard of you mr holmes i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards he said that you could solve anything he said too much that you are never beaten i have been beaten four times—three times by men and once by a woman but what is that compared with the number of your successes it is true that i have been generally successful then you may be so with me i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case it is no ordinary one none of those which come to me are i am the last court of appeal and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family you fill me with interest said holmes pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have as far as i can understand little to do with this awful business it is a hereditary matter so in order to give you an idea of the facts i must go back to the commencement of the affair you must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle elias and my father joseph my father had a small factory at coventry which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became a planter in florida where he was reported to have done very well at the time of the war he fought in jacksons army and afterwards under hood where he rose to be a colonel when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where he remained for three or four years about 1869 or 1870 he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham he had made a very considerable fortune in the states and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them he was a singular man fierce and quick-tempered very foul-mouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring disposition during all the years that he lived at horsham i doubt if ever he set foot in the town he had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily but he would see no society and did not want any friends not even his own brother he didnt mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so this would be in the year 1878 after he had been eight or nine years in england he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house i kept all the keys and could go where i liked and do what i liked so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy there was one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumber-room up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter with a boys curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room one day—it was in march 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonels plate it was not a common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort from india said he as he took it up pondicherry postmark what can this be opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate i began to laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand k k k he shrieked and then my god my god my sins have overtaken me what is it uncle i cried death said he and rising from the table he retired to his room leaving me palpitating with horror i took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter k three times repeated there was nothing else save the five dried pips what could be the reason of his overpowering terror i left the breakfast-table and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other they may do what they like but ill checkmate them still said he with an oath tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room to-day and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer i did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room the fire was burning brightly and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it as i glanced at the box i noticed with a start that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope i wish you john said my uncle to witness my will i leave my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to you if you can enjoy it in peace well and good if you find you cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest enemy i am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing but i cant say what turn things are going to take kindly sign the paper where mr fordham shows you i signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with him the singular incident made as you may think the deepest impression upon me and i pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives i could see a change in my uncle however he drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil when these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul at such times i have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little green-scummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of suicide but i who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some £ 14000 which lay to his credit at the bank one moment holmes interposed your statement is i foresee one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide the letter arrived on march 10 1883 his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may 2nd thank you pray proceed when my father took over the horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up we found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed on the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw for the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncles life in america some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the north well it was the beginning of 84 when my father came to live at horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the january of 85 on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table there he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one he had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself why what on earth does this mean john he stammered my heart had turned to lead it is k k k said i he looked inside the envelope so it is he cried here are the very letters but what is this written above them put the papers on the sundial i read peeping over his shoulder what papers what sundial he asked the sundial in the garden there is no other said i but the papers must be those that are destroyed pooh said he gripping hard at his courage we are in a civilised land here and we cant have tomfoolery of this kind where does the thing come from from dundee i answered glancing at the postmark some preposterous practical joke said he what have i to do with sundials and papers i shall take no notice of such nonsense i should certainly speak to the police i said and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort then let me do so no i forbid you i wont have a fuss made about such nonsense it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate man i went about however with a heart which was full of forebodings on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill i was glad that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home in that however i was in error upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major imploring me to come at once my father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull i hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness he had as it appears been returning from fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the chalk-pit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of death from accidental causes carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder there were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease and that i was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him in this sinister way i came into my inheritance you will ask me why i did not dispose of it i answer because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncles life and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another it was in january 85 that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then during that time i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended with the last generation i had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips this is the envelope he continued the postmark is london—eastern division within are the very words which were upon my fathers last message: k k k and then put the papers on the sundial what have you done asked holmes nothing nothing to tell the truth—he sank his face into his thin white hands—i have felt helpless i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against tut tut cried sherlock holmes you must act man or you are lost nothing but energy can save you this is no time for despair i have seen the police ah but they listened to my story with a smile i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings holmes shook his clenched hands in the air incredible imbecility he cried they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me has he come with you to-night no his orders were to stay in the house again holmes raved in the air why did you come to me he said and above all why did you not come at once i did not know it was only to-day that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you it is really two days since you had the letter we should have acted before this you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us there is one thing said john openshaw he rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured blue-tinted paper he laid it out upon the table i have some remembrance said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction beyond the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much i think myself that it is a page from some private diary the writing is undoubtedly my uncles holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book it was headed march 1869 and beneath were the following enigmatical notices: 4th hudson came same old platform 7th set the pips on mccauley paramore and john swain of st augustine 9th mccauley cleared 10th john swain cleared 12th visited paramore all well thank you said holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor and now you must on no account lose another instant we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me you must get home instantly and act what shall i do there is but one thing to do it must be done at once you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do you understand entirely do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present i think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties i thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his overcoat you have given me fresh life and hope i shall certainly do as you advise do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger how do you go back by train from waterloo it is not yet nine the streets will be crowded so i trust that you may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely i am armed that is well to-morrow i shall set to work upon your case i shall see you at horsham then no your secret lies in london it is there that i shall seek it then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers i shall take your advice in every particular he shook hands with us and took his leave outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows this strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling i think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this save perhaps the sign of four well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos but have you i asked formed any definite conception as to what these perils are there can be no question as to their nature he answered then what are they who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his finger-tips together the ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopædias is a somewhat rare accomplishment it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavoured in my case to do if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion yes i answered laughing it was a singular document philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i remember botany variable geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violin-player boxer swordsman lawyer and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco those i think were the main points of my analysis holmes grinned at the last item well he said i say now as i said then that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library where he can get it if he wants it now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night we need certainly to muster all our resources kindly hand me down the letter k of the _american encyclopædia_ which stands upon the shelf beside you thank you now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those letters the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london from east london what do you deduce from that they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that the probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a ship and now let us consider another point in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days does that suggest anything a greater distance to travel but the letter had also a greater distance to come then i do not see the point there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer it is possible more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay good god i cried what can it mean this relentless persecution the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroners jury there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society but of what society have you never— said sherlock holmes bending forward and sinking his voice—have you never heard of the ku klux klan i never have holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee here it is said he presently: ku klux klan a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle this terrible secret society was formed by some ex-confederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida its power was used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts melon seeds or orange pips in others on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the country if he braved the matter out death would unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner so perfect was the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south eventually in the year 1869 the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers it may well have been cause and effect it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered then the page we have seen— is such as we might expect it ran if i remember right sent the pips to a b and c—that is sent the societys warning to them then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him there is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men it had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down you will excuse me for not waiting for you said he i have i foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaws what steps will you take i asked it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries i may have to go down to horsham after all you will not go there first no i shall commence with the city just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee as i waited i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart holmes i cried you are too late ah said he laying down his cup i feared as much how was it done he spoke calmly but i could see that he was deeply moved my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading tragedy near waterloo bridge here is the account: between nine and ten last night police-constable cook of the h division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water the night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passers-by it was quite impossible to effect a rescue the alarm however was given and by the aid of the water-police the body was eventually recovered it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats the body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and shaken than i had ever seen him that hurts my pride watson he said at last it is a petty feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride it becomes a personal matter with me now and if god sends me health i shall set my hand upon this gang that he should come to me for help and that i should send him away to his death— he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last how could they have decoyed him down there the embankment is not on the direct line to the station the bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose well watson we shall see who will win in the long run i am going out now to the police no i shall be my own police when i have spun the web they may take the flies but not before all day i was engaged in my professional work and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street sherlock holmes had not come back yet it was nearly ten oclock before he entered looking pale and worn he walked up to the sideboard and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously washing it down with a long draught of water you are hungry i remarked starving it had escaped my memory i have had nothing since breakfast nothing not a bite i had no time to think of it and how have you succeeded well you have a clue i have them in the hollow of my hand young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them it is well thought of what do you mean he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope on the inside of the flap he wrote s h for j o then he sealed it and addressed it to captain james calhoun barque _lone star_ savannah georgia that will await him when he enters port said he chuckling it may give him a sleepless night he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him and who is this captain calhoun the leader of the gang i shall have the others but he first how did you trace it then he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with dates and names i have spent the whole day said he over lloyds registers and files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in 83 there were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months of these one the _lone star_ instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union texas i think i was not and am not sure which but i knew that the ship must have an american origin what then i searched the dundee records and when i found that the barque _lone star_ was there in january 85 my suspicion became a certainty i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london yes the _lone star_ had arrived here last week i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight what will you do then oh i have my hand upon him he and the two mates are as i learn the only native-born americans in the ship the others are finns and germans i know also that they were all three away from the ship last night i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo by the time that their sailing-ship reaches savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder there is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves was upon their track very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year we waited long for news of the _lone star_ of savannah but none ever reached us we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave with the letters l s carved upon it and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the _lone star_ vi the man with the twisted lip isa whitney brother of the late elias whitney dd principal of the theological college of st georges was much addicted to opium the habit grew upon him as i understand from some foolish freak when he was at college for having read de quinceys description of his dreams and sensations he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects he found as so many more have done that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives i can see him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pin-point pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble man one night—it was in june 89—there came a ring to my bell about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock i sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment a patient said she youll have to go out i groaned for i was newly come back from a weary day we heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps upon the linoleum our own door flew open and a lady clad in some dark-coloured stuff with a black veil entered the room you will excuse my calling so late she began and then suddenly losing her self-control she ran forward threw her arms about my wifes neck and sobbed upon her shoulder oh im in such trouble she cried i do so want a little help why said my wife pulling up her veil it is kate whitney how you startled me kate i had not an idea who you were when you came in i didnt know what to do so i came straight to you that was always the way folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse it was very sweet of you to come now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or should you rather that i sent james off to bed oh no no i want the doctors advice and help too its about isa he has not been home for two days i am so frightened about him it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husbands trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend and school companion we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find did she know where her husband was was it possible that we could bring him back to her it seems that it was she had the surest information that of late he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day and he had come back twitching and shattered in the evening but now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours and he lay there doubtless among the dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar of gold in upper swandam lane but what was she to do how could she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him there was the case and of course there was but one way out of it might i not escort her to this place and then as a second thought why should she come at all i was isa whitneys medical adviser and as such i had influence over him i could manage it better if i were alone i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at the time though the future only could show how strange it was to be but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge between a slop-shop and a gin-shop approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave i found the den of which i was in search ordering my cab to wait i passed down the steps worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door i found the latch and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the forecastle of an emigrant ship through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a dark lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes the most lay silent but some muttered to themselves and others talked together in a strange low monotonous voice
